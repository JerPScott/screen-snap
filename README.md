# screen-snap
A small WPF screen capture app

This started as an attempt to get a fast screen capture tool. Using managed code it doesnn't seem to be possible to get much more than 20 fps. This is not quick enough for my use case but I wrapped a WPF app around it and it could be a useful tool for some.
